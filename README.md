# Python-Price-Prediction

Introduction
Airbnb is a popular online platform focusing on short-term accommodation and homestay. Airbnb provides a marketplace for hosts (i.e., property owners) to publish their listings (spare houses, apartments, or rooms) for guests to view and lease. In New York City, there are approximately 40,000 listings available for the last quarter.
The project team is primarily motivated to predict the price per day of Airbnb listings based on other features and attributes, (e.g., neighborhood, number of rooms, amenities, etc.) With specific regression models chosen, we are further curious about which features contribute the most to the increase/decrease of the daily price of a listing.
It is also worth mentioning that Airbnb endows a “Superhost” title to the hosts who provide the most hospitable service and receive the highest ratings. Historical data shows that superhosts account for approximately 20% of all hosts. In consideration, the project team also wants to predict whether a host is a superhost, given the conditions of his/her listings.
The source code of this project is available at the course’s GitHub classroom repository and also available here. There are four ipython notebooks: 1. Price prediction, 2. Superhost classification, 3. Superhost classification neural network, 4. Visualizations
